## Executive Summary 
Rarita’s football players has found moderate success in the international scene of football however not when
representing Rarita as a nation. After recognising competitive sports team generally have benefits for the country’s
economy and global visibility, Rarita had explored ideas for creating a national team to participate in the
international Football and Sporting Association (FSA) League.

The Rarita national team had been developed with the objective for a high probability for winning the Football and
Sporting Association (FSA) League and to have a positive impact on Rarita’s economy. The gradient boosting
model was used for identifying player effectiveness after comparing several after models. A team of the best 24
players were selected using the model, which can be accessed [here](player_data_salaries_2020.csv) (wrong file, update later)

This combination of players had a high probability of 89.33% to be in the top 10 football nations in the next 5 years
and 41.65% for winning the championship within 10 years. Moreover, the team was found to a positive impact on
Rarita’s economy with an expected NPV of $18.742 billion and statistical evidence of increased GDP growth with a
national football team.
